0.05	Wed May 11 01:05:26 CEST 2005
	This new version correct some bugs, fully support the network, and I am now sure that a large part of the module works fine. 
	You can test a large part of functionnality by using the slack-getd perl script in the t/ directory.
	In this version there is a lot of debug print, if you want to test the slack-getd daemon you have to custom the config.xml file.
	The servers.xml can be used as it.
