slackget10

The slackget10 module is the core library of the release 1.0 of slack-get (http://slackget.infinityperl.org).
This library is still in development and all version 0.0* are CVS snapshots ! And this is highly possible that they didn't works at all !!!
For exemple the 0.02 version was bugged.

WARNING: the make test fail, because I don't provide a test suite for the moment.
